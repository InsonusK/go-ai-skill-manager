Feature: Git adapter process contract

 Scenario: Git clone arguments preserve branch and URL boundaries, then the cloned commit is read
  When I prepare a clone for branch "feature/demo"
  Then git calls are

 Scenario Outline: Real git takes a branch, a tag or a commit
  Given a git repository with commits
   | message | content | tag |
   | first   | one     | v1  |
   | second  | two     |     |
  When I clone that repository at "<tree>"
  Then the clone's file "f.txt" holds "<content>"
  And the clone's commit is the "<commit>" commit
  Examples:
   | tree   | content | commit |
   | master | two     | second |
   | v1     | one     | first  |
   | @first | one     | first  |
