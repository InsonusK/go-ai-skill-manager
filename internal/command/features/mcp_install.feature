Feature: Command line: mcp install and uninstall set up the MCP server in Claude Code's .mcp.json

 Background:
  Given CLI project
   """
   {"ai-skills.yaml":"sources:\n  - path: skills\ntarget: out\n"}
   """

 @category/happy
 Scenario: install writes the server next to the config, run by the name found in PATH
  Given the tool runs as "aism" found in PATH
  When I run arguments "mcp install"
  Then exit code is "0"
  And project JSON file ".mcp.json" is

  And stdout contains "Added MCP server ai-skill-manager to "
