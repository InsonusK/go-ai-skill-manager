Feature: MCP tools: the agent drafts a skill feedback, the user confirms it in the client's dialog

 # Checked on the current protocol (multi round-trip requests) and on the
 # one before it (server-initiated elicitation). The fake tracker answers
 # https://github.com/o/r/issues/<n>.

 Background:
  Given the skill "guide" comes from "github" "https://github.com/o/r"
  And the skill "notes" comes from "local" "/p/skills"
