Feature: Feedback about a skill goes to its source's issue tracker only as the user confirmed it

 # Drafts are compared as {ID, Status, Kind, Skill, Source, Commit,
 # SkillPath, Title, Body, IssueURL, CreatedAt, SentAt}; the fake tracker
 # answers with https://github.com/o/r/issues/<n>.

 Background:
  Given the managed skills are
   | target            | skill | type   | path                  | tree | commit | skill_path |
   | /p/.claude/skills | guide | github | https://github.com/o/r | main | c0ffee | a/guide    |
   | /p/.claude/skills | notes | local  | /home/me/skills       |      |        | notes      |
   | /p/.claude/skills | odd   | gitlab | https://gitlab.com/o/r |      |        | odd        |
   | /p/.agents/skills | guide | github | https://github.com/o/other |  | beef   | guide      |
  And the feedback targets are "/p/.claude/skills,/p/.agents/skills"
  And it is "2026-09-27T10:00:00Z"

 Scenario: A draft takes the skill's source from the first target holding it and shows the issue it would open
  When I draft a "bug" feedback on "guide" titled "Broken anchor" with body "The anchor #x is missing."
  Then the feedback succeeds
