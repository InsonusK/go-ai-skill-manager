Feature: SkillCatalog.FetchByPathUp finds the valid skill whose folder holds a path

 # FetchByPathUp searches up from the path: it checks the path's own folder
 # (the path itself when it is a folder) and then each parent folder up to
 # the repository folder, and returns the first skill's folder it meets --
 # or the path itself when it is a flat "*.skill.md" skill. It never loads
 # neighbour skills and remembers nothing -- that is addPath's job.
