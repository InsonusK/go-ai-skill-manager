Feature: LinkFactory collects links from its registered parsers

 # Fake parsers report the spans they are told to and parse any raw text
 # into a ParsedLink whose Format is the parser's name and whose Path is the raw
 # text it received. Start and End are left empty by the fake, so the
 # factory is the only thing that can fill them.
